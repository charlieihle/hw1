      Mobile
    </h1>
      <p>
        Nowadays, we can't ignore mobile anymore. A website that is not prepared
        for mobile devices could cost you clients and make you look
        unprofessional.

            In 2013, 73%  of all internet users accessed the  web   from   a
            mobile   device.   This  is predicted to be over 90% in 2017.

        About us
      </h1>
          <p>
            WebsiteChef    is   a   tight-knit    group   of experienced
            designers   and   developers with   a   passion    for   creating
            custom websites.  For  years now,  we  see people spending a lot
            of money on websites that aren't   even   custom   made.
            Just   some template     that   is    being    (minimally)
            customized  as  if  it  were  their  own. We want you  to know
            we don't  take part  in this. We think everyone should have the
            opportunity  to  have  a  custom  website,
            built  by  professionals,  at  an  affordable price.
          </p>

            For my event agency, I often need a website for a new event.
            Websitechef always makes sure I can launch quickly, make it look
            just the way I want it to while still being very affordable.
            I found myself a perfect business partner!

            My driving-school really needed some help getting online.
            Websitechef built me a beautiful, fast and well functioning website.
            I've already acquired multiple new students through my new website
              so you will believe me when I say I'm thrilled!
